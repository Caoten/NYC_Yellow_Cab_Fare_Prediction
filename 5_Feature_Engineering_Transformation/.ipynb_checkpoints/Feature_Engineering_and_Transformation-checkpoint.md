## Ideas for Feature Engineering and Transformation
***
* View of the Taxi Driver (Input):

    * Pickup Geolocation:
        * Borough
        * Zone
        * Block
    * Datetime (Pickup):
        * Date
        * Year
        * Month
        * Day 
        * Hour
    * Weather Condition:
        * Storm
        * Rainfall
    * Holiday:
    
    

* Feature Engineering:

    * Time-based:
        * Date
        * Month
        * Day
        * Hour
    * Geolocation (Pickup):
        * Borough
        * Zone
        * Block
    * Weather Condition:
        * 
        * 
    * Holiday:
    * Is Weekend?
    * Season
        

* Transformation:
    * Target Feature (Fare_Amt):
        * Categorical Feauture
        * High=
        * Middle=
        * Low=
    * Geolocation (Pickup):
        * Blocklevel
    * Time based:
        *

 * Idea:
     * easy Model vs. complex Model(Linear Regression vs Neural Network?)
     * Without new Features
     * 1. With the outliers high distance low fare and low distance with high fare
     * 2. Without Weather data
     *
